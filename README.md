# BungeeForge
BungeeForge is a Forge mod that implements BungeeCord (legacy) protocol.
At first it was developed to support Velocity legacy forwarding but it can also work for other Bungee proxies. 

### Usage:
- Download the mod into mods/ directory on your server
- Setup Velocity (velocity.toml) option `player-info-forwarding-mode` to `legacy`
- Configure your Forge server (server.properties) option `online-mode` to `false`
- Connect through Velocity to your Forge server
- You should see skins and IP forwarding works

### Other versions
Other Forge versions can be supported. Submit issue and feel free to ask.
